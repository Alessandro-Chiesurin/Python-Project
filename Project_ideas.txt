Project ideas and brainstorming 

-The difficult of a game is an important thing, we need to know what the user wants
    before giving him a rated list
    ->Problem, the given dataset hasn't the difficult rating metric, might need a new 
    dataset 
    With the new dataset might be intresting understend the correlation between difficult
    and rating 
    Are more difficult games raked higher compared to lower difficult games?
    I can also create an user variable asking if he preffers easy medium or difficult games 
    and then create a list according to his liking 

-We can check the user, not every user is competent, they are not expert, chechking who
    gives some ratings might be a smart move 
    ->The given dataset has only a row for a game, not a row for a vote, so it's very
    unlikely that this idea can be used 

-We have only the avrage, the geek score (A bayes avrage), the amount of reviews and 
    the rank of the game 
    With this data we can understand how a rank is connected with the avrage and The
    geek score 

Thing do to 
-Import Data 
-Polish Data 
1-Is BBG biased? look at the official ranking ad let's see if difficult games are rated 
    higher, same thing for player year ecc
2-User ranking
-Cut the dataset according to user liking
    Ex  min/max players
        Difficulty 
        Pubblication year 
        ecc ecc 
-Build a coherent ranking 
-Give the coherent ranking in a aestethic way
